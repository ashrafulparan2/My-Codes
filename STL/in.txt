Over the past few decades,technology has been changing at an ever-increasing rate. The pressure to develop new products, improve the performance of existing systems, and create new markets will only accelerate that rate. This pressure, however, is also what makes the field so exciting. New ways of storing information, constructing integrated circuits, and developing hardware that contains software components that can “think”on their own based on data input are only a few possibilities. Change has always been part of the human experience, but it used to be gradual. This is no longer true. Just think, for example, that it was only a few years ago that TVs with wide, flat screens were introduced. Already, these have been eclipsed by high-definition TVs with images so crystal clear that they seem almost three-dimensional. Miniaturization has also made possible huge advances in electronic systems. Cell phones that originally were the size of notebooks are now smaller than a deck of playing cards. In addition, these new versions record videos, transmit photos, send text messages, and have calendars, reminders, calculators, games, and lists of frequently called numbers. Boom boxes playing audio cassettes have been replaced by pocket-sized iPods® that can store 30,000 songs or 25,000 photos. Hearing aids with higher power levels that are almost invisible in the ear, TVs with 1-inch screens—the list of new or improved products continues to expand because significantly smaller electronic systems have been developed. This reduction in size of electronic systems is due primarily to an important innovation introduced in 1958—the integrated circuit (IC).An integrated circuit can now contain features less than 50 nanometers across. The fact that measurements are now being made in nanometers has resulted in the terminology nanotechnology to refer to the production of integrated circuits called nanochips. To understand nanometers, consider drawing 100 lines within the boundaries of 1 inch. Then attempt drawing 1000 lines within the same length. Cutting 50-nanometer features would require drawing over 500,000 lines in 1 inch. The integrated circuit shown in Fig. 1 is an Intel® Core 2 Extreme quad-core processor that has 291 million

transistors in each dual-core chip. The result is that the entire package, which is about the size of three postage stamps, has almost 600 million transistors—a number hard to comprehend. However, before a decision is made on such dramatic reductions in size, the system must be designed and tested to determine if it is worth constructing as an integrated circuit. That design process requires engineers who know the characteristics of each device used in the system, including undesirable characteristics that are part of any electronic element. In other words, there are no ideal (perfect) elements in an electronic design. Considering the limitations of each component is necessary to ensure a reliable response under all conditions of temperature, vibration, and effects of the surrounding environment. To develop this awareness requires time and must begin with understanding the basic characteristics of the device, as covered in this text. One of the objectives of this text is to explain how ideal components work and their function in a network. Another is to explain conditions in which components may not be ideal.
